# MolRot Package

This is a tomography and interferometry package. In it, we present a method for performing tomography on the rotational states on a diatomic molecular ion
(molecule), as well as interferometry. 

Currently the interferometry projects is aimed at implementing the functionality of detecting a constant electric field from its dipole interaction with the molecular ion.

It is planned to include at module for state creation/design in the near future.
